# SAT

The goal of SAT is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of SAT from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("SAT")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JianqiaoWang/SAT")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(SAT)
## basic example code
p <- 1*10^5; ## total number of pairs
d1 = 100; d2 = 100; d3 = 1;
X <- c(rep(0,p-(d1 + d2 + d3)),rep(1,d1),rep(2,d2),rep(3,d3));
mu.1 = rep(0, p); mu.2 = rep(0, p);
mu.1[X==1|X==3] = 4; mu.2[X==2|X==3] = 5;
Z1 <- mu.1 + rnorm(p,0,1);
Z2 <- mu.2 + rnorm(p,0,1);
T1 = abs(Z1);T2 = abs(Z2);
P1 = 2* (1 - pnorm( T1)); P2 = 2* (1 - pnorm(T2));
SAT::MinDetect(P1, P2)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
